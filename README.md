# Rash-Driving-And-Accident-Alert-System-Using-Arduino-NodeMCU-
A definitive and comprehensive vehicle accident and rash driving identification and alert system using NodeMCU.
 it has a fully functional and independent circuitry. It combines the features of Invensense’s MPU6050, Ublox Neo-6M GPS module with NodeMCU to a great effect.
 
 MPU6050 is a combination of the accelerometer and the gyroscope, with both the modules help the other with the data to overcome the shortcomings. Accelerometer records the acceleration across 3 axes, whereas the gyroscope records the rotational velocity across the axis. 
 
 The GPS module encodes the data in the form NMEA format, which can be used to carve out the exact location of the misfortune. 
 
 In addition to that, a mail is also sent to the registered mail id through an API call embedded with the google link. A service called IFTTT connects different services to help us send the mail. The email conveys the message and also sends the location of the accident to the user. 

 
 I am attaching a dedtailed report in order to understand it in this link :- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yh3zYPw87xqiCKTjcD9S8f8z12OmDoHM/view?usp=sharing
